# Loan-default-prediction-models
A comparative study of loan default machine-learning prediction models for small business loans

The goal of this research project is to help financial institutions decide which loans to approve by giving officers access to more information and tools. Also, this study
aims to minimise the bias by finding the main features that explain the likelihood of default on small business loans and comparing multiple prediction models to find the
best fit for this particular data set.

This comparative analysis of four different loan approval prediction models using machine learning techniques and data from small businesses in the USA will focus on
models such as decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, and XGBoost.

Each model will be trained and tested using the US Small Business Administration data set, and all will be compared using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,
and f1-score so the best algorithm for loan predictions can be identified and used for future research projects.
